Palm Pre-style application switcher for iPhone OS
 by rpetrich and chpwn
 
Requires iPhone SDK 3.0+ to compile and iPhone OS 3.0+ to run, and if you want screenshots in simulator builds, Snow Leopard is needed
If DebMaker is installed, it will be used to make deb packages for device builds

Uses MobileSubstrate (saurik) as loader
Uses CaptainHook (rpetrich) as hooker
Uses code from kirikae (ashikase) to track apps; also best used with his Backgrounder app :)
